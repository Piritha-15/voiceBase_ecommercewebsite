# ⚡ Button Commands - Voice Alternative Solution

## 🎯 The Problem

Chrome's Web Speech API isn't working on your system due to network/regional restrictions. Google's speech recognition service isn't accessible from your location or network.

## ✅ The Solution

I've created a **Button Commands** system that gives you the same functionality without needing speech recognition!
